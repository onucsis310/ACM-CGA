John, 

Below are sample queries that I need tested. Each query follows the same format, so it is only necessary to test one Knowledge area's information.

/*Below are the queries for getting Knowledge Units*/
select Name from Knowledge_Unit where Name like 'AL/%';

/*Below are the queries for getting Topics*/
/*AL*/
select Name from Tier1_Topic join Tier2_Topic on Tier1_Topic.Knowledge_Unit = Tier2_Topic.Knowledge_Unit join Elective_Topic on Tier2_Topic.Knowledge_Unit = Elective_Topic.Knowledge_Unit join Tier1_Topic on Elective_Topic.Knowledge_Unit = Tier1_Topic.Knowledge_Unit where Name like 'AL/%';

select Name from Tier2_Topic join Tier1_Topic on Tier2_Topic.Knowledge_Unit = Tier1_Topic.Knowledge_Unit join Elective_Topic on Tier1_Topic.Knowledge_Unit = Elective_Topic.Knowledge_Unit join Tier2_Topic on Elective_Topic.Knowledge_Unit = Tier2_Topic.Knowledge_Unit where Name like 'AL/%';

select Name from Elective_Topic join Tier2_Topic on Elective_Topic.Knowledge_Unit = Tier2_Topic.Knowledge_Unit join Tier1_Topic on Tier2_Topic.Knowledge_Unit = Tier1_Topic.Knowledge_Unit join Elective_Topic on Tier1_Topic.Knowledge_Unit = Elective_Topic.Knowledge_Unit where Name like 'AL/%';

/*Below are the queries for getting the Outcomes*/
/*AL*/
select Name from Tier1_Outcomes join Tier2_Outcomes on Tier1_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit = Tier2_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit join Elective_Outcomes on Tier2_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit = Elective_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit join Tier1_Outcomes on Elective_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit = Tier1_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit where Name like 'AL/%';

select Name from Tier2_Outcomes join Tier1_Outcomes on Tier2_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit = Tier1_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit join Elective_Outcomes on Tier1_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit = Elective_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit join Tier2_Outcomes on Elective_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit = Tier2_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit where Name like 'AL/%';

select Name from Elective_Outcomes join Tier2_Outcomes on Elective_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit = Tier2_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit join Tier1_Outcomes on Tier2_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit = Tier1_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit join Elective_Outcomes on Tier1_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit = Elective_Outcomes.Knowledge_Unit where Name like 'AL/%';

If you have any questions, let me know.
